	ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

  This protocol is used to discover the local hardware address for machines
  given their IP address.

  Our goal is to report the mapping of IP address to MAC address. Some of the
  bits of data we discover will be tied to a MAC address only (such as wifi
  probes), others will be tied to an IP address.

  TODO: Eventually we'll keep a table of mappings so that we can detect when
  the mappings change, such as when one person logs off and another person
  logs on, and is given the IP address of the previous person. We need to
  create a "break" at this point, so that we don't accidentally associate 
  different people with the same IP address
