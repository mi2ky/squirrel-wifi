HOW TO BUILD

For Linux, type "make". This creates "bin/squirrel" binary.

For Windows, choose the project that best fits your version of Visual Studio.
(You don't need Cygwin, but that might work too).

For everything else, start with the build/gcc4/Makefile as inspiration.
The code is pretty portable, so shouldn't require much changes.


HOW TO RUN

This is a web-application. The 'squirrel' executable runs it's own
webserver (default: port 1234). Connect to it with your browser at
http://localhost:1234.

This means you have to run the program from the "www" directory. For
example, type "cd www" to go into that directory, then type something
like "../bin/squirrel -i mon0" to start monitorign interface "mon0".
