Squirrel is a typical WiFi monitoring system (like Kismet or airodump-ng). What makes it different from those other projects is that it's interface is Web 2.0, rather than text or GUI. It uses XML queries to update the page in real time. Because web-pages can be scrolled, it's much easier than other projects for huge monitoring projects (like driving around town). Also, web pages can be saved to produce "reports" for pentest projects. Finally, it does a better job monitoring client devices than other monitors (with smartphones having WiFi, the number of client devices is huge).
